# Task-manager
This project is a basic user and task management system in Python. It allows users to register, log in, add tasks, view all tasks, view their own tasks, and view system statistics. Administrators can also register new users and view additional statistics. Task details include the assignee, task title, description, due date, creation date, and task status. The system stores user credentials in a text file and task data in another text file, offering a simple yet functional way to manage tasks and user accounts.
